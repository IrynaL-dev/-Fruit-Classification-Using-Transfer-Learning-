Set up and organize a complex fruit image dataset.
Use transfer learning with the VGG16 model.
Fine-tune a pre-trained model for your dataset.
Evaluate and interpret the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.

You need to perform the following tasks to complete the project after preparing the data:

Task 1: Print the version of TensorFlow
Task 2: Create a test generator using the test_datagen object
Task 3: Print the length of the train generator
Task 4: Print the summary of the model
Task 5: Compile the model
Task 6: Plot accuracy curves for training and validation sets
Task 7: Plot loss curves for training and validation sets (fine-tuned model)
Task 8: Plot accuracy curves for training and validation sets (fine-tuned model)
Task 9: Plot a test image using the Extract Features Model
Task 10: Plot a test image using the Fine-Tuned Model
